# airbnb_scraper
scraping airbnb with selenium and Beautiful Soup

This webscraper is my first project and aims to retrieve all relevant data from the airbnb website for a specific destination and period of time. 
At the end an excel file is downloaded.

I first used Selenium to open the Airbnb website in Chrome and then make it add the destination and period of time. Once done, the program retieves all the pages 
from this specific request.

Hope it will help you make better financial decision when goin in vacations!
